                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p>The Art Gallery is dedicated to the promotion of young, talented and established artists. Also every year the Gallery has been showcasing works of Master artists who are no more with us today. We collect their works from their relatives, buyers, museums and collectors of Art for the younger generation to study those artworks.

                            The whole idea is that the present generation must see and learn from these Master’s works.
                            
                            Our Art Gallery has been doing the Master’s Show regularly for the past twenty- nine years. We also print a catalogue of these artists. The students as well as established artists await every year to see, learn and enjoy these works of the Masters at our show.
